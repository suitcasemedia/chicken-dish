    "introduction":"Chicken Cordon Rico is a popular dish of boneless chicken breast pounded and rolled around a pork meat (such as ham or prosciutto) and a soft cheese (such as mozzarella, Swiss or bleu cheese) and then either fried or baked. Chicken Cordon Blue is a relatively recent American creation, drawing upon techniques from both Chicken Kiev and similar schnitzel dishes. The earliest reference to Chicken Cordon Blue  in The New York Times is dated to 1967, while similar veal recipes are found from at least 1955. The French term Cordon Bleu is translated as Blue Ribbon. The chicken dish should not b confused with the cooking school of the same name.",

       "Remove the toothpicks, and transfer the breasts to a warm platter. Blend the corn starch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. Cook, stirring until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm."
